**1. Overview Of the Project**
**Objective**: Provide precise estimates of property values to aid buyers, sellers, and real estate agents.
Analyze trends and patterns in the real estate market to understand factors influencing property prices.

**2. Key Activity**
1. Data Collection
Objective: Gather relevant data on properties and market conditions.
Activities:
Collect historical property sales data.
Obtain property features (e.g., size, location, number of bedrooms, amenities).

2. Data Preprocessing
Objective: Prepare the collected data for analysis.
Activities:
Clean the data by handling missing values and outliers.
Normalize or standardize the data to ensure consistency.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Objective: Understand the data and identify key patterns and relationships.
Activities:
Visualize data distributions and relationships using plots and charts.
Identify correlations between features and target variable (house prices).

4. Model Selection
Objective: Choose appropriate models for house price prediction.
Activities:
Select a variety of models to test (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, neural networks).

5. Model Training
Objective: Train the selected models using the training data.
Activities:
Fit the models to the training data.
Use cross-validation to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.

6. Model Evaluation
Objective: Assess the performance of the trained models.
Activities:
Evaluate the models on the validation and test sets.
Compare model performance using relevant metrics.
